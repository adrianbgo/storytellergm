      "The D&D sessions with Adrian have created some of highest quality time I’ve had with my eight-year-old son. In a world where children are glued to electronics, Adrian manages to inspire them into a magical space for three hours using only dice, pencils, graph paper and creativity.",

    quote:
      "Adrian is a true professional, and brings life to the game in a way that we would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere... his experience as an educator makes integrating new players into the group an absolute breeze. He is charismatic and fair, and makes it impossible not to have a good time during our sessions... even when he’s telling you that you are being hacked to pieces by an army of ghostly warriors.",
